#Item Catalog

This is my submission to the Udacity Full Stack Developer course 'Item Catalog' project.

## Requirements

[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)

## How to run the code

First clone the virtual machine. Start it up and ssh into it.

	git clone git@github.com:mkjems/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git
	cd fullstack-nanodegree-vm/vagrant/
	vagrant up
	vagrant ssh

Once you are in

	cd /vagrant/item_catalog
	make run

You should then be able to view the Restaurant website on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
